# Exploring Iceland's Golden Circle in Winter

Iceland in winter is a magical experience. The Golden Circle route takes you through some of the country's most iconic natural wonders, and experiencing them covered in snow and ice adds an extra layer of beauty.

## The Route

The Golden Circle is a ~300 km loop from Reykjavik that includes three main stops:

1. **Þingvellir National Park** - Where the North American and Eurasian tectonic plates meet
2. **Geysir Geothermal Area** - Home to Strokkur, which erupts every 5-10 minutes
3. **Gullfoss Waterfall** - A massive two-tiered waterfall

## Day 1: Þingvellir National Park

Started early to catch the sunrise at Þingvellir. The park is a UNESCO World Heritage site and the location of Iceland's first parliament in 930 AD.

### The Silfra Fissure

Hiked along the Almannagjá gorge, the visible rift between continents. In summer, you can snorkel in the crystal-clear water of Silfra fissure—one of the few places on Earth where you can touch two continents at once.

## Day 2: Geysir and Gullfoss

### Strokkur Geyser

Watching Strokkur erupt is mesmerizing. The anticipation builds as the water bubbles, then suddenly—whoosh!—a column of boiling water shoots 20-30 meters into the air.

**Photography tip**: Use burst mode and position yourself downwind to avoid the spray!

### Gullfoss in Winter

Gullfoss (Golden Falls) is partially frozen in winter, creating otherworldly ice formations. The combination of mist, ice, and the roaring water creates a surreal atmosphere.

## Night 3: Chasing the Northern Lights

Clear skies and low light pollution made for perfect aurora viewing conditions. Set up near Þingvellir and was rewarded with dancing green curtains across the sky.

**Aurora hunting tips:**
- Use the aurora forecast app
- Get away from city lights
- Be patient—they can appear suddenly
- Camera settings: 15-25s exposure, f/2.8, ISO 1600-3200

## Gear Notes

- **Camera**: Sony A7IV with 24-70mm f/2.8
- **Tripod**: Essential for night photography
- **Clothing**: Multiple layers, waterproof outer shell
- **Crampons**: Necessary for walking on ice

## Practical Information

**Best time**: December to March for Northern Lights  
**Duration**: 2-4 days recommended  
**Accommodation**: Stayed in Reykjavik and did day trips  
**Car rental**: 4WD recommended in winter  

## Conclusion

Iceland's Golden Circle is accessible year-round, but winter offers unique experiences. The combination of geological wonders, winter landscapes, and the Northern Lights makes it an unforgettable adventure.

Planning to return in summer to explore the highlands and complete the Ring Road!
