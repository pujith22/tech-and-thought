# Hiking the Appalachian Trail: A Week in the Smokies

The Great Smoky Mountains offer some of the most spectacular hiking on the Appalachian Trail. This week-long adventure took me through ancient forests, over mountain peaks, and into the heart of America's most visited national park.

## Day 1: Newfound Gap to Icewater Spring Shelter

Started at Newfound Gap (5,046 ft) and hiked 7 miles to Icewater Spring Shelter. The trail immediately climbs through spruce-fir forest, offering stunning views of the surrounding peaks.

**Highlights:**
- Charlie's Bunion viewpoint
- Spectacular sunset from camp
- Met fellow thru-hikers heading to Maine

## Day 2-3: Traversing the High Country

The next two days involved traversing the spine of the Smokies, staying above 5,000 feet for much of the time. The trail alternates between dense forest and exposed ridgelines.

### Wildlife Encounters

Saw multiple black bears (from a safe distance), deer, and countless species of birds. The biodiversity here is incredible—the park has more tree species than all of Europe.

## Gear That Worked

- **Pack**: Osprey Aether 65L
- **Tent**: Big Agnes Copper Spur HV UL2
- **Sleeping Bag**: Western Mountaineering Versalite (20°F)
- **Stove**: MSR PocketRocket 2

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start early**: The trail gets crowded after 9 AM
2. **Filter all water**: Giardia is present in these streams
3. **Hang your food**: Bears are active and food storage is mandatory
4. **Layer up**: Temperatures can swing 30°F from day to night

## Final Thoughts

The Smokies section of the AT is challenging but incredibly rewarding. The combination of elevation changes, dense forests, and spectacular views makes it a must-do for any serious hiker.

**Total stats:**
- Distance: 112 km (70 miles)
- Elevation gain: 3,200 meters (10,500 feet)
- Duration: 7 days
- Average pace: 16 km/day

Would I do it again? Absolutely. Next time, I'm planning to tackle the full Georgia-to-Maine thru-hike.
