I'm Pujith Sai Kumar Korlepara, currently pursuing my M.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Bombay (2025-2027).\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>Background</h2>\n        <p>\n          Prior to joining IIT Bombay, I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at <a href=\"https://my.getsimpl.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Simpl Inc.</a>, a BNPL (Buy Now Pay Later) fintech startup. \n          I owned the payments-api microservice responsible for handling inbound re-payments, working with technologies like Ruby on Rails, Golang, Postgres, Kafka, and event-driven architecture.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          After about 2 years of work experience, I took a career break to pursue personal goals and prepare for GATE 2025. I cracked it with an All India Rank of 163 out of ~179,000 candidates, which led me to IIT Bombay.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>Research Interests</h2>\n        <p>\n          My interests lie at the intersection of <strong>systems engineering and machine intelligence</strong>. I'm currently investigating how intelligent agents can be deployed over the web to complement traditional information retrieval techniques for better query processing and relevancy enhancement.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          I'm exploring both traditional IR methods and how LLMs store corpus information and evaluate search queries. If you're interested in Mathematics, Machine Intelligence, or Computer Science and would like to brainstorm ideas, feel free to connect!\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>Achievements</h2>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Meta Hacker Cup 2025: Worldwide rank 669 in Round 2</li>\n          <li>GATE 2025: AIR 163 in Computer Science</li>\n          <li>ICPC Kanpur Regionals 2021: 80th place</li>\n          <li>Freelance Tutor: Trained students for ICPC, IOI, USACO with notable results including a bronze medalist at NOI Singapore 2024</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <h2>Beyond Work</h2>\n        <p>\n          I enjoy volleyball, badminton, chess, gaming (PC/PS5), playing piano, reading books, and freelance tutoring. \n          I've been teaching Data Structures and Algorithms online since the COVID pandemic (2021) on the Teacheron platform.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>This Blog</h2>\n        <p>\n          This is my digital space to share technical deep dives, research explorations, and personal reflections. \n          It's a window into my journey of continuous learning in systems, ML, and beyond.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n"],"names":[],"mappings":";;;;;;;;AAAO,MAAM,WAAW;IACtB,OAAO;IACP,aAAa;AACf;AAEe,SAAS;IACtB,qBACE,8OAAC;QAAI,WAAU;;0BACb,8OAAC;gBAAG,WAAU;0BAAqB;;;;;;0BAEnC,8OAAC;gBAAI,WAAU;;kCACb,8OAAC;kCAAE;;;;;;kCAIH,8OAAC;kCAAG;;;;;;kCACJ,8OAAC;;4BAAE;0CACsE,8OAAC;gCAAE,MAAK;gCAA2B,QAAO;gCAAS,KAAI;0CAAsB;;;;;;4BAAc;;;;;;;kCAIpK,8OAAC;kCAAE;;;;;;kCAIH,8OAAC;kCAAG;;;;;;kCACJ,8OAAC;;4BAAE;0CACuC,8OAAC;0CAAO;;;;;;4BAAqD;;;;;;;kCAGvG,8OAAC;kCAAE;;;;;;kCAIH,8OAAC;kCAAG;;;;;;kCACJ,8OAAC;;0CACC,8OAAC;0CAAG;;;;;;0CACJ,8OAAC;0CAAG;;;;;;0CACJ,8OAAC;0CAAG;;;;;;0CACJ,8OAAC;0CAAG;;;;;;;;;;;;kCAGN,8OAAC;kCAAG;;;;;;kCACJ,8OAAC;kCAAE;;;;;;kCAKH,8OAAC;kCAAG;;;;;;kCACJ,8OAAC;kCAAE;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAOX"}}]
